# Speeduino-CAN-Gauges
An analog stepper motor gauge cluster that gets data over serial from a speeduino ECU

 - AX1201728SG stepper drivers and X25.168 stepper motors
 - right now setup for 5 gauges
 - warning LED's on each gauge
 - LED Alternator excite that should work with most cars that normally use a incandescent bulb as an excite
 - Arduino Nano controlled
 - two spare analog inputs if wanted to have a button to control the 7-seg display, or analog input over CAN as a sensor for a speeduino

This is all a work in process, I worked through this pretty quick so there are a few areas that need refining but hopfully getting this out there allows people to pick and choose parts for their own projects.
